We develop a system of ODEs to model breast cancer by piecing together models for tumor burden, chemotherapy, and immune response.
First, we choose a model for uninhibited breast cancer growth.
Then, we examine the separate effects of chemotherapy treatments and two types of immune cells (NK and CD8) on breast cancer.
Finally, we explain our method for piecing them together and examine the results of our overall model.
