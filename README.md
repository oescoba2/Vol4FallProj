# Vol4FallProj
This is the repo where we will store all of work, notes, journals, citations, drafts, datasets, or other things. The main_material folder is to store versions of material that is close to its final version and should not contain any other work besides material that will be in our final report or final code.

* src_code: this folder will contain all of our code, even those we will not use. We can store different versions or other things we deem important. Note all should be code.
* workspace: these folders are our own individual folders where we can add things to it we want. This is where we can test our things before we move them to other folders with the approval of all team members. Think of this as scratch work.
* 1stDraft: this is the folder that will contain our material we will need for our first draft submission. This has been completed as of 21 Nov 2024.
