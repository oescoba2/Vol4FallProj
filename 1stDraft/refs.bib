abstract = {A mathematical model is used to discuss the effects of cycle-specific chemotherapy. The model includes a constraint equation which describes the effects of the drugs on sensitive normal tissue such as bone marrow. This model investigates both pulsed and piecewise-continuous chemotherapeutic effects and calculates the parameter regions of acceptable dose and period. It also identifies the optimal period needed for maximal tumor reduction. Examples are included concerning the use of growth factors and how they can enhance the cell kill of the chemotherapeutic drugs.}

abstract = {In this study, we investigated a mathematical model for chemoimmunotherapy (a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy) for brain cancer. In most cases, the standard protocol for cancer treatment is fixed in terms of treatment time intervals and dosages. We offer a wide range of non-fixed protocols, which essentially vary in terms of time intervals and dosages (i.e., personalised medicine). The functions that describe this treatment are explicit and analytical. Hence, the parameters of the function can be easily changed and a new protocol can be obtained. We compared different protocols and obtained an optimal solution. In addition, we applied the singular perturbed vector field (SPVF) method to determine the hierarchy of the system of equations, which enabled us to identify the equilibrium points of the mathematical model and investigate their stability.}

abstract = {The proposed model describes the interaction among normal, immune and tumor cells in a tumor with a chemotherapeutic drug, using a system of four coupled partial differential equations. The dimensions of the tumor and initial conditions of tumor cells are chosen under the assumption that the tumor is already large enough in size to be detectable with the available clinical devices. The pattern of distribution of tumor cells is drafted on the basis of clinical observations. The stability of the system is established with tumor and tumor-free equilibria. The process of tumor regression with the introduction of different diffusion coefficients of tumor and immune cells is considered along with normal cells of tissue without any diffusive movement. It is shown that the results of chemotherapy treatment are in agreement with Jeff’s phenomenon. The response of three different levels of immune system strength to the pulsed chemotherapy are investigated. It is observed that the tumor performs better if a chemotherapeutic drug is injected near the invasive fronts of the tumor.}

ABSTRACT = {Changes in diet are heavily associated with high mortality rates in several types of cancer. In this paper, a new mathematical model of tumor cells growth is established to dynamically demonstrate the effects of abnormal cell progression on the cells affected by the tumor in terms of the immune system’s functionality and normal cells’ dynamic growth. This model is called the normal-tumor-immune-unhealthy diet model (NTIUNHDM) and governed by a system of ordinary differential equations. In the NTIUNHDM, there are three main populations normal cells, tumor cell and immune cells. The model is discussed analytically and numerically by utilizing a fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. The dynamic behavior of the NTIUNHDM is discussed by analyzing the stability of the system at various equilibrium points and the Mathematica software is used to simulate the model. From analysis and simulation of the NTIUNHDM, it can be deduced that instability of the response stage, due to a weak immune system, is classified as one of the main reasons for the coexistence of abnormal cells and normal cells. Additionally, it is obvious that the NTIUNHDM has only one stable case when abnormal cells begin progressing into early stages of tumor cells such that the immune cells are generated once. Thus, early boosting of the immune system might contribute to reducing the risk of cancer.},

    abstract = {Mathematical models of tumor-immune interactions provide an analytic framework in which to address specific questions about tumor-immune dynamics. We present a new mathematical model that describes tumor-immune interactions, focusing on the role of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells in tumor surveillance, with the goal of understanding the dynamics of immune-mediated tumor rejection. The model describes tumor-immune cell interactions using a system of differential equations. The functions describing tumor-immune growth, response, and interaction rates, as well as associated variables, are developed using a least-squares method combined with a numerical differential equations solver. Parameter estimates and model validations use data from published mouse and human studies. Specifically, CD8+ T-tumor and NK-tumor lysis data from chromium release assays as well as in vivo tumor growth data are used. A variable sensitivity analysis is done on the model. The new functional forms developed show that there is a clear distinction between the dynamics of NK and CD8+ T cells. Simulations of tumor growth using different levels of immune stimulating ligands, effector cells, and tumor challenge are able to reproduce data from the published studies. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the variable to which the model is most sensitive is patient specific, and can be measured with a chromium release assay. The variable sensitivity analysis suggests that the model can predict which patients may positively respond to treatment. Computer simulations highlight the importance of CD8+ T-cell activation in cancer therapy.},
